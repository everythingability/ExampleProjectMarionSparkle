# Example Twine Project - incorporating Marion Sparkle

This project is a Twine Chapbook project that I will use to teach Twine, here:

This project contains three things.

It has examples of:

* How to use certain codes in Twine, like Delayed Text, or how to play ambient sounds - I've tried to select the simplest and the coolest. One of my big bug bears is having to read documentation THEN figure out how to implement it. I find it much easier to work with a simple working site, adapt it, break it, fix it and so understand it.
* Some ready-to-use media, just because if we're learning Twine we don't want to focus too much on going to find media, because you can lose days doing that.
* The beginnings of a story about Marion Sparkle, a plucky cabbage from the fine town of Hostornmer. This is so that you can explore adding your own passages to it, to extend the story, without needing an actual story to tell. This is just so you get an idea of some of the mechanics of it.

Of course once you've spent a little time breaking this project, then you'll have concocted your own story and have learned enough to start from scratch.

A demo version of the Examples and Marion will be available here:
